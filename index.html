        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This case study explores the challenges biotech professionals face when using <b>Microsoft Dynamics NAV</b> for work order and inventory management. Our team focused on identifying pain points in the workflow and designing solutions to improve efficiency and usability.</p>
        <p>BioLegend, a biotech company specializing in manufacturing and distributing biomedical research reagents, relies on software like <b>Microsoft Dynamics NAV</b> to track inventory, manage orders, and ensure accurate shipment of lab products. However, existing systems present a steep learning curve, require excessive manual input, and lead to inefficiencies in critical workflows. Through user research, we identified core usability problems and proposed an improved interface that balances efficiency and clarity.</p>

    <section id="problem">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Dynamics NAV</strong> is a powerful tool for managing biotech workflows but suffers from usability challenges, particularly for employees who need to navigate complex inventory management and order fulfillment processes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fragmented User Flow:</strong> Frequent pop-ups and multiple tabs disrupt workflow, forcing users to memorize product details instead of providing contextual guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>High Cognitive Load:</strong> Employees must manually track inventory levels and remember lot numbers while switching between screens, leading to errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Visual Aids:</strong> The interface is highly text-based, making it difficult for new employees to quickly learn the system and reducing overall efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="research">
        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>To better understand user pain points, we conducted interviews and surveys with biotech professionals who regularly use <b>Microsoft Dynamics NAV</b>. Our research methods included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> We interviewed lab technicians and inventory managers to uncover workflow inefficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Contextual Inquiry:</strong> Observed users performing daily tasks to identify friction points and bottlenecks.</li>
            <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Collected feedback on common pain points and feature requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Learning Curve:</strong> New employees struggle to onboard due to a lack of visual aids and guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficient Task Switching:</strong> Users frequently switch between multiple tabs and screens to complete tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Data Entry Errors:</strong> Repetitive manual input leads to mistakes, increasing time spent on corrections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on these findings, we focused on simplifying navigation, improving visual hierarchy, and enhancing automation to reduce user workload.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="design">
        <h2>Design Process & UI Flow</h2>
        <p>Our design approach focused on streamlining the workflow and reducing cognitive load for users by implementing the following UI enhancements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduced a simplified navigation system to minimize excessive tab switching.</li>
            <li>Designed work order screens with clear visual hierarchies.</li>
            <li>Implemented a search and filter function to quickly locate inventory items.</li>
        </ul>
